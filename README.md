# teensyMIDItoolkit

This repository is created towards helping students to learn the art of USB MIDI.  

You will find examples of arduino code written for teensy boards (especially teensy LC) making it easy to convert your board into a professional MIDI interface using capacitive touch, analog and digital inputs, accelerometers (LIS3DH with I2C), etc.

The examples are organised from practising diverse techniques.

To begin, grasp your teensy board, install Arduino if you do not have it already and its extension for Teensy called "Teensyduino". For that go to: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html

# Practice 1: First MIDI instrument: Control Change with one Analog Sensor
Learn how to create one MIDI Control Change with one Analog Sensor with this tutorial: https://github.com/ultranoise/teensyMIDItoolkit/tree/master/AnalogControlChange-oneInput

# Practice 2: Trigger a MIDI note with a button
Add one button to the previous project using the following code: https://github.com/ultranoise/teensyMIDItoolkit/tree/master/note-oneButton

# Practice 3: Read capacitive touch input and transmit it as CC MIDI
Add one touch (capacitive) input to the previous project using the following code: https://github.com/ultranoise/teensyMIDItoolkit/tree/master/oneTouch-calibrated
