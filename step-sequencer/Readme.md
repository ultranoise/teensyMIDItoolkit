# Create a basic step sequencer

In this practice you will experiment with the simplest possible step sequencer for MIDI (probably a bit jitterish...)

1) Upload the following code: 
  It is a monophonic 16-steps sequencer without any control. It produces 10 notes per second.
  
2) Test it with your favourite synth. 
  
3) Add controls to this monophonic sequencer with the circuit of the previous practices (LDR, button, touch) for controlling speed, play/stop, frequencies, etc. 

4) Test it with your favourite synth

5) Show it to the class
