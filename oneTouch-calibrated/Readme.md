# Read capacitive input, calibrate it and transmit it as MIDI CC and Pitch Bend

1) In this example we will read one capacitive (touch) pin of the Teensy LC. Add a jumper cable (blue in the picture below) to pin 1. You can also physically connect an electrolytic object to the cable (fruits, wood, some plastics, etc)

2) LetÂ´s begin with CC: use the code from this example alone: https://github.com/ultranoise/teensyMIDItoolkit/blob/master/oneTouch-calibrated/teenys-onetouch-calibrated.ino

3) Map it and test it with your favourite synth.

4) Integrate it to the previous code (LDR + button) so that now you have it all using two CC values and a chord trigger. 

5) Map it all with your favourite synth and test it.

6) Now modify the code for transmiting Pitch Bend instead of CC with the capacitive pin. For that you will have to use the instruction:

```
usbMIDI.sendPitchBend(value, channel); 
```
taking into account that the pitch bend range is not 0-127 but 0-16383 (14 bits) so you will have to update your map() instruction. 

7) Map it and test it with your favourite synth.

8) Show it to the class
